/**
 * Composite is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a

 * Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require
 * building a tree structure. Compositeâ€™s great feature is the ability to run
 * methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
